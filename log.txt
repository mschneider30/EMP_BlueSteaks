Summarized Plan:
- Run linear search and binary search multiple times on certain array length and calculate average time spent.
- Best to note ALL measurements to track possible outliers.
- Repeat for arrays of exponentially larger lengths.

Refactored Plan:
- Run linear search and binary search multiple times on certain array length and calculate average time spent.
- Don't need to note all measurements since it crowds console and also any outliers can be eliminated by just taking more measurements so they don't affect the average significantly.
- Repeat for arrays of increasingly larger lengths to better see relationship between binary search and linear search over time.
- Printed headers for each test of a specific array length to better read our data.
