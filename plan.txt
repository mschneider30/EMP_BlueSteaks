Plan for Lab 03: Get Empirical

BinSearch.java
LinSearch.java

Search Driver create 5 OALs(ordered array lists) of length 0,1,2,3,4
	-create 4 OALs of length 10,20,30,40
	-do linear search on every index of every list
		-record time before and after
		-put the difference in a print statement
		-create double array of every time
		-create a method that compares the two array s and counts the number of times each one was faster. Returns both counters

If LinSearch counter is above 0, the hypothesis is true
